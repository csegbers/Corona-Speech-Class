CoronaSpeechClass
=================

Corona Text to Speech class using Google service

Speech class sample app allows you to send in any size text and the class will parse, 
splitting into 100 byte chunks or period or comma for natural speech. Google only allows 100 per call
so the class will handle this for you splitting and building multiple wav files and play them. You also can
simply build the files without playing. Multipl language support etc..

have fun, suggestions welcome.
